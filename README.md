## Description

This is a js project based on buying items, which will be added to the shopping cart. Every time we buy an item, it will be added to the cart, updating the total purchase price.

Keep in mind that for the items to be saved in the shopping cart, we need local storage to store the information and for data persistence to work correctly.
